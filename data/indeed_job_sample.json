Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis. </p>\n <p>U-Haul co-founders L.S. \"Sam\" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born. </p>\n <p>AMERCO and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no AMERCO or U-Haul company will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.</p>\n</div>", "company_star_rating": null, "company_review_count": null, "company_website": null, "company_id": null, "website": null, "job_link": "https://www.indeed.com/applystart?jk=fa85980a4c395081&from=vj&pos=top&mvj=0&spon=0&sjdu=YmZE5d5THV8u75cuc0H6Y26AwfY51UOGmh3Z9h4OvXiw4XZ37vlSaZVjLUp9I-HT2Lr7DfU83qy6ilMSvPFMEw&astse=be7a4baf2342ec9f&assa=6306", "expired": true, "indeed_origin_country": "www", "qualifications": [], "benefits": ["401(k)", "Credit union membership", "Employee assistance program", "Employee stock ownership plan", "Gym membership", "Health insurance", "Life insurance", "On-the-job training", "Opportunities for advancement", "Tuition reimbursement", "Vision insurance"], "salary": {"salary_min": 44214.074, "salary_max": 55984.87, "salary_type": "YEARLY", "salary_text": "$44.2K - $56K a year"}, "job_type": null, "is_sponsored": false, "is_featured_employer": false}},

Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis. </p>\n <p>U-Haul co-founders L.S. \"Sam\" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born. </p>\n <p>U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.</p>\n</div>", "company_star_rating": 3.5, "company_review_count": 6417, "company_website": null, "company_id": "U-Haul", "website": null, "job_link": "https://www.indeed.com/applystart?jk=b619a885a15f811e&from=vj&pos=top&mvj=0&spon=0&sjdu=YmZE5d5THV8u75cuc0H6Y26AwfY51UOGmh3Z9h4OvXgwdae3jzm0gcUJScPgNqQYGQFsFDP3gSdjjHZnj9ZEfg&astse=894504e23ed93c8b&assa=8402", "expired": true, "indeed_origin_country": "www", "qualifications": [], "benefits": ["401(k)", "Employee assistance program", "Employee stock ownership plan", "Gym membership", "Health insurance", "Life insurance", "Opportunities for advancement", "Vision insurance"], "salary": null, "job_type": null, "is_sponsored": false, "is_featured_employer": false, "is_urgently_hiring": false, "is_easy_apply": false, "is_responsive_employer": false, "is_multiple_candidates": false, "shift_schedule": null, "accepts_remote": false}},
