Er wordt nauw samengewerkt met ons Business analyse team (BAT), met onze uitvoerende medewerkers en met de DevOps teams onderling binnen het domein. Het liefst hebben we veel en vaak interactie met onze interne en externe eindgebruikers om zo de juiste dingen te maken. We werken multidisciplinair in een dynamische omgeving.<br>\n<br>\nWie zoeken we?<br>\nJij bent een enthousiaste, flexibele OPS&rsquo;er die het leuk vindt om het bestaande examenlandschap te vernieuwen. Je bent leergierig en hebt interesse in cloud- en containertechnieken zoals OpenShift, Docker en Helm. Je gaat een uitdaging niet uit de weg en wil je nieuw opgedane<br>\nkennis graag delen met de collega&rsquo;s binnen en buiten het team. Doordat de staatsexamens seizoensgebonden zijn, hebben we qua beheerwerk een drukke periode tussen mei en september, en een relatief rustige periode van oktober tot en met april. In deze periode is er veel gelegenheid om te werken aan procesverbeteringen, automatisering, je eigen vaardigheden en vakgroep gerelateerde activiteiten zoals werkgroepen. Hierin bieden wij je de ruimte, dus ben jij iemand die zijn eigen uitdaging kan maken, dan heb je hier een unieke kans!<br>\n<br>\nWat bieden we?<br>\nAls OPS-er bij Examens werk je mee aan de vernieuwing van het examenlandschap. Je thuisbasis is &eacute;&eacute;n van de 3 DevOps teams maar regelmatig heb je ook contact met de collega&rsquo;s uit de andere 2 teams. Door mee te draaien met het ontwikkelteam kun je invloed uitoefenen op het product dat ontstaat. De uitdaging hierin is dat we moeten verbouwen met de winkel open. Het resultaat waar we naar toe werken is een hele nieuwe omgeving: applicaties die in de cloud draaien en dat biedt de mogelijkheid om kennis op te doen van nieuwe technieken en tools, denk bv. aan Kubernetes, Docker, Helm etc.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Eisen:</b>\n<ul><li>HBO werk- en denkniveau</li>\n<li>Ervaring met automated deployen</li>\n<li>Ervaring met cloud- en of containertechnieken</li>\n<li>Ervaring met GitOPS</li>\n<li>Ervaring met het inrichten, installeren en beheren van applicaties op een containeromgeving 3 jaar</li>\n<li>Relevante werkervaring in een Agile / Scrum omgeving 3 jaar</li>\n<li>Ervaring met het inrichten van monitoring 3 jaar</li></ul><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Wensen:</b>\n<ul><li>Ervaring met MQ, databases en SQL is een pr&eacute;</li>\n<li>Kennis van Gitlab-ci is een pr&eacute;</li>\n<li>Kennis van Jenkins is een pr&eacute;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met IBMi (AS400 en DB2) is een pr&eacute;\n</li></ul><b>Competenties:</b>\n<ul><li>Analyserend vermogen en goed kunnen samenwerken</li>\n<li>Pro-actief benaderen andere stakeholders/teams, initiatiefrijk zijn</li>\n<li>Assertieve teamspeler</li>\n<li>Resultaatgerichtheid</li>\n<li>Pro-actief &amp; Kennis van Gitlab Argo CD, Helm &amp; OpenShift/Kubernetes</li></ul><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Reageren kan nog tot bovenstaande deadline door middel van een CV in word format en een korte motivatie</b><b><i> </i></b><b>met vermelding van beschikbaarheid en tarief.</b></div>", "website": "www.fixedtoday.nl", "expired": true, "salary_estimate_type": "Glassdoor est."}},

We are seeking highly self-motivated applicants with strong experimental attitude to apply for this position.</p>\n<p><b>Key Responsibilities and research objectives</b></p>\n<p>There is a growing interest in developing cryogenic devices for quantum technologies, so to overcome a number of limitations the community is facing in the quest for an efficient quantum processor. Site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) are excellent candidates for the mission, while facing challenges of their own. The EPN group is world leading the effort to establish advanced site-controlled QD technology, aiming at photonic mode control and enhancement (e.g. tailored cavities and/or waveguiding system), quantum light quality and entanglement in it various expressions (e.g. biexciton-exciton cascade, cluster states etc..).</p>\n<p>Recent results on the unique system developed at Tyndall were featured in major reviews, such as Nature Photonics (e.g. Gediminas Juska, et al. &ldquo;Towards quantum dot based arrays of entangled photon emitters&rdquo;, Nature Photonics 7, 527 (2013); T. H. Chung, et al. &ldquo;Selective carrier injection into patterned arrays of pyramidal quantum dots for entangled photon light-emitting diodes&rdquo;, Nature Photonics 10, 782 (2016)). Similarly, EPN has been at the forefront of growth understanding and modelling, see e.g.: V. Dimastrodonato, E. Pelucchi, and D. D. Vvedensky. &quot;Self-limiting evolution of seeded quantum wires and dots on patterned substrates.&quot; Physical Review Letters 108.25 (2012): 256102; A. M.

Growth Des. 2021, 21, 4, 2068&ndash;2075</p>\n<p>The main focus of this position will be on two fronts: on one side participate to the quantum optic challenges of the developed QD based structures, by advancing photon correlation spectroscopy, dual resonant pumping, and, generally, methods for selectively address specific and unusual quantum dot resonances and their potential exploitation in quantum processing schemes. On the other hand, a strong effort will be put in developing quantum dot devices (e.g. cavities, photonic integration, especially with the QD category generally called as &ldquo;small pitch&rdquo; dots) suitable for the exploitation of quantum processing protocols.</p>\n<p>The work will include, in collaboration with the rest of the team, running the quantum optics laboratory, cleanroom processing and structural characterization techniques, such as AFM at various degrees depending on project developments.</p>\n<p>The PhD candidate is also expected to collaborate intensively with the rest of the EPN group on other subjects close to the PhD topics.</p>\n<p><b>Other responsibilities</b></p>\n<ul><li>Participate in Education and Public Engagement activities, as required.</li>\n<li>Ensure all activities are compliant with the Tyndall Quality Management system.</li>\n<li>Ensure all activities are compliant with the required Health and Safety standards.</li>\n<li>Carry out any additional duties as may reasonably be required within the general scope and level of the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Essential criteria</b></p>\n<ul><li>The minimum academic qualification is a first honors degree (or an equivalent international degree) in physics, electronic engineering or related relevant discipline, with a proved curriculum centered on material properties (and their quantum properties)</li>\n<li>Masters degrees on the same topics are welcome and will have a preferential consideration, while should also show first class achievements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Desirable Criteria</b></p>\n<ul><li>Applicants to have experience in quantum optics or other topics close to the proposed research</li>\n<li>Highly self-motivated applicants with strong experimental attitude.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An annual student stipend of &euro;19,000 applies for this successful candidate for this position.

We imagine, build, and scale innovations, leverage research and other knowledge to connect the desire for change with informed action, and work to shift the narrative so that decision-makers and the public understand what&rsquo;s at stake and what&rsquo;s possible.</p>\n<p>\nSpecifically, we work to reduce the number of people caught up in harmful legal systems by creating alternatives that are responsive, restorative, fair, and effective; to improve living conditions and life outcomes and safeguard fundamental human rights for the millions of people still subject to mass incarceration; and to expand opportunities for formerly incarcerated and other system-involved people to heal, fully participate in community life, and reach their potential. We operate from the understanding that the struggle for justice takes place in a context of historic, systemic, and pervasive racism.</p>\n<p>\nWe are a diverse and allied staff of reformers, transformers, abolitionists, and dreamers who bring a wide range of knowledge, skill, and life experience to the challenging work we undertake together. We&rsquo;re committed to living our values and to creating the kinds of equitable and inclusive team environments internally that we fight to help create in our broader communities. This includes providing opportunities to all job applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, national origin, age, criminal history, disability, or genetics. The organization strongly encourages people of color, individuals who identify as part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer communities, and individuals impacted by the legal system to join the team.
